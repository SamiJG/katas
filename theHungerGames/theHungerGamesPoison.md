> ## Story
> Old MacDingle had a farm.
> 
> It was a free-range chicken farm with a fox problem, as we learned earlier:
> 
> Ref: The Hunger Games - Foxes and Chickens
> So old MacDingle decided to lay fox bait around the farm to poison the foxes.
> 
> Foxes F eat chickens C
> 
> When foxes eat fox bait X they die.
> 
> Fox bait is harmless to chickens.
> 
> Chickens in cages [] are safe (unless a fox has got into the cage with them!)
> 
> ## Kata Task
>
> Given the initial configuration of foxes and chickens what will the farm look like the next morning after the hungry foxes have been feasting?
> 
> ## Examples
> 
> Ex1 - chickens outside cages when foxes about

>```
> Before:  CCC[CCC]FCC[CCCCC]CFFFF[CCC]FFFF
> After: ...[CCC]F..[CCCCC].FFFF[CCC]FFFF
>```
>
> Ex2 - a fox in a chicken cage	
>
>```
> Before: ...[CCC]...[CCCFC].....[CCC]....
> After: ...[CCC]...[...F.].....[CCC]....
>```
>
> Ex3 - foxes are poisoned	
>
>```
> Before: CCCCC...XCCCCCCCCC....FFF.X..CF
> After: CCCCC...X.................X....
>```
>
> Ex4 - a bit of everything	
>
>```
> Before...CC...X...[CCC]CCC[CCCXCCCF]CCCC[CFC]FCC
> After	...CC...X...[CCC]...[CCCX....]....[.F.]...
> ```
>
> ## Notes
> Anything not a fox, a chicken, fox bait, or a cage is just dirt .
> All cages are intact (not open-ended), and there are no cages inside other cages
> The same fox bait can kill any number of foxes
> A hungry fox will always eat as many chickens as he can get to, before he is tempted by the bait
